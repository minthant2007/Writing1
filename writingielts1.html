  <p style="font-size: 35px"> I conducted a survey to ten of my friends what their favourite activity, which I had listed above, they would like to do was. My observation indicates that the most favourite activity is listening to music as it is very popular in today's era. Almost four of them responded that listening to music was their favourite activity and was incredibly enjoyable. Approximately three of them expressed a desire to hang out with friends. The last three guys has a distinct hobby. One likes esport, one likes eating and the last one likes football. I also asked them which activity they did infrequently. According to my observation, three dislike movies, four dislike football, one dislike esport, one dislike reading and the last dislike eating.</p>
